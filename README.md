# Deep-Dungeon
It is an ongoing project. It started as a way to learn Unity. Then evolved into a bachelor thesis and became a small demo of a roguelike game with random levels, enemies, obstacles and pickups.
For my master thesis level generation has been focused on and now Deep Dungeon is a set of four different level generators. The parameters can be maniuplated via an interface and the effect can be seen after entering the game. Most of the other features have been disabled.
In the future I plan to reenable all the features and add new ones to the improved levels.
